Note:

Most of the common code is written in the helper_function.py file which includes static estimation calculation and rest of the functions required to perform the moves, place pieces, etc.


All the codes are tested on python 3.7 and above it may or may not work for versions below it (most probably it will for any python version 3.2 and above)
Code is tested in linux environment.
